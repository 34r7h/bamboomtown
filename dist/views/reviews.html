Excellent to see that we can dream and then create with such success and these skis of yours prove that. From coastal pud to dicy traverses in the Alps, speed flying with tele bindings on (an anomaly in Europe) to dragging big pack these things did not fail me. Ease of turn, lightness, beauty and durability amazing across the board. As for price, value, durability comparison there seems to be nothing else out there …. they are truly a beautiful work of design and craftsmanship ……the number of positive complements received from the Euros pros who tried my pair proved that they are really special ….. all mountain machines…..thanks for being the kind who follows his dream and makes it happen. These are truly a Canadian model of success.
